In this project, the goal is to load a CSV file, extract specific information, transform the data into JSON and then save it to a new file.

Tasks

1.Load the CSV file in the notebook from your forked repository.

2.Use a distinct field to retrieve data, like:

    a.Type of wine (red or white)

    b.Wine score range or baseline (e.g. between 90 and 92 points)

    c.Region

3.Capture every row that matches your condition, and after processing, save everything to a formatted new JSON file.
